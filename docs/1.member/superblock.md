### Superblock 

The ‘Superblock’ app is a moderation method for your own stream. While Hubzilla's normal functionality only allows you to block users you are connected to using the contact tool, Superblock works regardless of whether you are connected to a contact or not.

If you notice a user in the stream with whom you are not connected (because their posts are shared by a contact from your own address book) and - for whatever reason - you do not want to have any posts from this Fediverse user in the stream, you can achieve this with the ‘Superblock’ app.

To do this, click on the small white triangle in the avatar of the user you want to block.

A pull-down menu opens, which contains the menu item ‘Block completely’ at the bottom. Clicking on this menu item places the user in the superblock list. Posts from this user will no longer appear in their own stream. Affected posts are immediately hidden in the stream. In addition, this user will no longer be able to read your posts, regardless of their authorisations, nor will they be able to post to your channel.

If you select the ‘Superblock’ app in the app menu (top right ⋮), a list of all blocked contacts is displayed.

A ‘rubbish bin icon’ is displayed next to each contact. Click on this icon to remove the user from the block list. The user can then follow you again, see your posts and also comment on them and their posts will also appear in the stream again (e.g. by sharing a contact).

Superblock is not installed and activated by default for new channels.
