#### Share 

When posts are shared (forwarded), a post by another user is posted again on your own channel. A new conversation is created in your own channel. Comments are added to the new conversation and not to the original one.
Sharing posts only works from the stream or your own channel, but not from a ‘third-party’ channel.
