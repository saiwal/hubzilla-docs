### Tags 

Tags (also called thematic tags, hashtags or topical tags) Tags are displayed by prefixing the tag name with the ‘#’ character. This creates a link in the post to a generalised website search for the specified term. For example, #cars will provide a search link for all posts that mention ‘cars’ on your website. Topical tags are usually at least three characters long. Shorter search terms are unlikely to return search results, but this depends on the database configuration.

Thematic tags are also usually not linked if they are purely numeric, e.g. #1. If you wish to use a numeric hashtag, please include descriptive text such as #2012-elections or enclose the entire tag in double quotes (e.g. #"2012″). Double quotes are also required if the tag contains spaces (#"My Tag") and may be required if the tag contains punctuation (#"EndsWithPeriod." Or #"Exciting !!!").
