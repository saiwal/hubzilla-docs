### post

Process POST requests.

if this method completes without error or stopping processing in other
ways.

Process GET requests or the body part of POST requests.

```php
public get(): string
```

This method is called directly for GET requests, and immediately after the
`post()` method for POST requests.

It will return the module content as a HTML string.







**Return Value:**

HTML content for the module.
