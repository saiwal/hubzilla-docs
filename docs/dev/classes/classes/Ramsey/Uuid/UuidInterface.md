# UuidInterface

A UUID is a universally unique identifier adhering to an agreed-upon
representation format and standard for generation



* Full name: `\Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface`
* Parent interfaces: [`\Ramsey\Uuid\DeprecatedUuidInterface`](./DeprecatedUuidInterface.md), [`JsonSerializable`](../../JsonSerializable.md), [`Serializable`](../../Serializable.md), [`Stringable`](../../Stringable.md)


## Methods


### compareTo

Returns -1, 0, or 1 if the UUID is less than, equal to, or greater than
the other UUID

```php
public compareTo(\Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface $other): int&lt;-1, 1&gt;
```

The first of two UUIDs is greater than the second if the most
significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for the first
UUID.

* Q. What's the value of being able to sort UUIDs?
* A. Use them as keys in a B-Tree or similar mapping.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$other` | **\Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface** | The UUID to compare |


**Return Value:**

-1, 0, or 1 if the UUID is less than, equal to, or greater than $other




***

### equals

Returns true if the UUID is equal to the provided object

```php
public equals(object|null $other): bool
```

The result is true if and only if the argument is not null, is a UUID
object, has the same variant, and contains the same value, bit for bit,
as the UUID.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$other` | **object&#124;null** | An object to test for equality with this UUID |


**Return Value:**

True if the other object is equal to this UUID




***

### getBytes

```php
public getBytes(): string
```












***

### getFields

```












***

### getInteger

Returns the integer representation of the UUID

```php
public getInteger(): \Ramsey\Uuid\Type\Integer
```












***

### getUrn

Returns the string standard representation of the UUID as a URN

```php
public getUrn(): string
```
