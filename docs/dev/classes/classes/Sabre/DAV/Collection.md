* This class is an **Abstract class**




## Methods


### getChild

Returns a child object, by its name.

```php
public getChild(string $name): \Sabre\DAV\INode
```

This method makes use of the getChildren method to grab all the child
nodes, and compares the name.
Generally its wise to override this, as this can usually be optimized

This method must throw Sabre\DAV\Exception\NotFound if the node does not
exist.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** |  |




**Throws:**

- [`NotFound`](./Exception/NotFound.md)



***

### childExists

Checks is a child-node exists.

```php
public childExists(string $name): bool
```

It is generally a good idea to try and override this. Usually it can be optimized.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** |  |





***

### createFile

Creates a new file in the directory.

```php
public createFile(string $name, resource|string $data = null): string|null
```

Data will either be supplied as a stream resource, or in certain cases
as a string. Keep in mind that you may have to support either.

After successful creation of the file, you may choose to return the ETag
of the new file here.

The returned ETag must be surrounded by double-quotes (The quotes should
be part of the actual string).

If you cannot accurately determine the ETag, you should not return it.
If you don't store the file exactly as-is (you're transforming it
somehow) you should also not return an ETag.

This means that if a subsequent GET to this new file does not exactly
return the same contents of what was submitted here, you are strongly
recommended to omit the ETag.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** | Name of the file |
| `$data` | **resource&#124;string** | Initial payload |
