# Service_limits

Base controller class for Modules.

Modules should extend this class, and override the methods needed. Emtpy
default implementations allow Modules to only override the methods they
need.

The methods defined by this class is invoked in order:

  - init()
  - post() -- only for POST requests
  - get()

Modules which emit other serialisations besides HTML (XML,JSON, etc.) should
do so within the module `init` and/or `post` functions and then invoke
`killme()` to terminate further processing.

* Full name: `\Zotlabs\Module\Service_limits`
* Parent class: [`\Zotlabs\Web\Controller`](../Web/Controller.md)

`post()` method for POST requests.

## Inherited methods


### init

Initialize request processing.

```php
public init(): mixed
```

This method is called before any other request processing, and
regardless of the request method. The theme is not yet loaded when
this method is invoked.










***

### post

Process POST requests.

```php
public post(): mixed
```

This method is called if the incoming request is a POST request. It is
invoked after the theme has been loaded. This method should not normally
render HTML output, as processing will fall through to the GET processing
if this method completes without error or stopping processing in other
ways.

### get
