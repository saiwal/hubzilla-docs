# Overview

Hubzilla is more than a simple web application. It is a
complex communications system which more closely resembles an email server
than a web server. For reliability and performance, messages are delivered in
the background and are queued for later delivery when sites are down. This
kind of functionality requires a bit more of the host system than the typical
blog. Not every PHP/MySQL hosting provider will be able to support
Hubzilla. Many will but please review the requirements and confirm these
with your hosting provider prior to installation.

We've tried very hard to ensure that $Projectname will run on commodity
hosting platforms such as those used to host Wordpress blogs and Drupal
websites. It will run on most any Linux VPS system. Windows LAMP platforms
such as XAMPP and WAMP are not officially supported at this time however
we welcome patches if you manage to get it working.

### Where to find more help
If you encounter problems or have issues not addressed in this documentation,
please let us know via the [Github issue
tracker](https://framagit.org/hubzilla/core/issues). Please be as clear as you
can about your operating environment and provide as much detail as possible
about any error messages you may see, so that we can prevent it from happening
in the future. Due to the large variety of operating systems and PHP platforms
in existence we may have only limited ability to debug your PHP installation or
acquire any missing modules, but we will do our best to solve any general code
issues.
