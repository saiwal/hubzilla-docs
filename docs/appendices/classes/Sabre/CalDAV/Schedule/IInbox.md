# IInbox

Implement this interface to have a node be recognized as a CalDAV scheduling
inbox.



* Full name: `\Sabre\CalDAV\Schedule\IInbox`
* Parent interfaces: [`\Sabre\CalDAV\ICalendarObjectContainer`](../ICalendarObjectContainer.md), [`\Sabre\DAVACL\IACL`](../../DAVACL/IACL.md)




## Inherited methods


### delete

Deleted the current node.

```php
public delete(): mixed
```












***

### getName

Returns the name of the node.

```php
public getName(): string
```

This is used to generate the url.










***

### setName

Renames the node.

```php
public setName(string $name): mixed
```








**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** | The new name |





***

### getLastModified

Returns the last modification time, as a unix timestamp. Return null
if the information is not available.

```php
public getLastModified(): int|null
```












***

### getOwner

Returns the owner principal.

```php
public getOwner(): string|null
```

This must be a url to a principal, or null if there's no owner










***

### getGroup

Returns a group principal.

```php
public getGroup(): string|null
```

This must be a url to a principal, or null if there's no owner










***

### getACL

Returns a list of ACE's for this node.

```php
public getACL(): array
```

Each ACE has the following properties:
* 'privilege', a string such as {DAV:}read or {DAV:}write. These are
  currently the only supported privileges
* 'principal', a url to the principal who owns the node
* 'protected' (optional), indicating that this ACE is not allowed to
   be updated.










***

### setACL

Updates the ACL.

```php
public setACL(array $acl): mixed
```

This method will receive a list of new ACE's as an array argument.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$acl` | **array** |  |





***

### getSupportedPrivilegeSet

Returns the list of supported privileges for this node.

```php
public getSupportedPrivilegeSet(): array|null
```

The returned data structure is a list of nested privileges.
See Sabre\DAVACL\Plugin::getDefaultSupportedPrivilegeSet for a simple
standard structure.

If null is returned from this method, the default privilege set is used,
which is fine for most common usecases.










***

### createFile

Creates a new file in the directory.

```php
public createFile(string $name, resource|string $data = null): string|null
```

Data will either be supplied as a stream resource, or in certain cases
as a string. Keep in mind that you may have to support either.

After successful creation of the file, you may choose to return the ETag
of the new file here.

The returned ETag must be surrounded by double-quotes (The quotes should
be part of the actual string).

If you cannot accurately determine the ETag, you should not return it.
If you don't store the file exactly as-is (you're transforming it
somehow) you should also not return an ETag.

This means that if a subsequent GET to this new file does not exactly
return the same contents of what was submitted here, you are strongly
recommended to omit the ETag.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** | Name of the file |
| `$data` | **resource&#124;string** | Initial payload |





***

### createDirectory

Creates a new subdirectory.

```php
public createDirectory(string $name): mixed
```








**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** |  |





***

### getChild

Returns a specific child node, referenced by its name.

```php
public getChild(string $name): \Sabre\DAV\INode
```

This method must throw Sabre\DAV\Exception\NotFound if the node does not
exist.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** |  |





***

### getChildren

Returns an array with all the child nodes.

```php
public getChildren(): \Sabre\DAV\INode[]
```












***

### childExists

Checks if a child-node with the specified name exists.

```php
public childExists(string $name): bool
```








**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** |  |





***

### calendarQuery

Performs a calendar-query on the contents of this calendar.

```php
public calendarQuery(array $filters): array
```

The calendar-query is defined in RFC4791 : CalDAV. Using the
calendar-query it is possible for a client to request a specific set of
object, based on contents of iCalendar properties, date-ranges and
iCalendar component types (VTODO, VEVENT).

This method should just return a list of (relative) urls that match this
query.

The list of filters are specified as an array. The exact array is
documented by \Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarQueryParser.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$filters` | **array** |  |
