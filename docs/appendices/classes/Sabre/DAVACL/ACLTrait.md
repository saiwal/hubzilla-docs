# ACLTrait

This trait is a default implementation of the IACL interface.

In many cases you only want to implement 1 or to of the IACL functions,
this trait allows you to be a bit lazier.

By default this trait grants all privileges to the owner of the resource.

* Full name: `\Sabre\DAVACL\ACLTrait`




## Methods


### getOwner

Returns the owner principal.

```php
public getOwner(): string|null
```

This must be a url to a principal, or null if there's no owner










***

### getGroup

Returns a group principal.

```php
public getGroup(): string|null
```

This must be a url to a principal, or null if there's no owner










***

### getACL

Returns a list of ACE's for this node.

```php
public getACL(): array
```

Each ACE has the following properties:
* 'privilege', a string such as {DAV:}read or {DAV:}write. These are
  currently the only supported privileges
* 'principal', a url to the principal who owns the node
* 'protected' (optional), indicating that this ACE is not allowed to
   be updated.










***

### setACL

Updates the ACL.

```php
public setACL(array $acl): mixed
```

This method will receive a list of new ACE's as an array argument.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$acl` | **array** |  |





***

### getSupportedPrivilegeSet

Returns the list of supported privileges for this node.

```php
public getSupportedPrivilegeSet(): array|null
```

The returned data structure is a list of nested privileges.
See Sabre\DAVACL\Plugin::getDefaultSupportedPrivilegeSet for a simple
standard structure.

If null is returned from this method, the default privilege set is used,
which is fine for most common usecases.
