# XmlSerializable

Objects implementing XmlSerializable can control how they are represented in
Xml.



* Full name: `\Sabre\Xml\XmlSerializable`



## Methods


### xmlSerialize

The xmlSerialize method is called during xml writing.

```php
public xmlSerialize(\Sabre\Xml\Writer $writer): mixed
```

Use the $writer argument to write its own xml serialization.

An important note: do _not_ create a parent element. Any element
implementing XmlSerializable should only ever write what's considered
its 'inner xml'.

The parent of the current element is responsible for writing a
containing element.

This allows serializers to be re-used for different element names.

If you are opening new elements, you must also close them again.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$writer` | **\Sabre\Xml\Writer** |  |
