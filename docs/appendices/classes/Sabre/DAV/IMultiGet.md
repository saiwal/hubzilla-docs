# IMultiGet

IMultiGet.

This interface adds a tiny bit of functionality to collections.

There a certain situations, in particular in relation to WebDAV-Sync, CalDAV
and CardDAV, where information for a list of items will be requested.

Because the getChild() call is the main abstraction method, this can in
reality result in many database calls, which could potentially be
optimized.

The MultiGet interface is used by the server in these cases.

* Full name: `\Sabre\DAV\IMultiGet`

## Methods


### getMultipleChildren

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `$paths` | **string[]** |  |

## Inherited methods

Deleted the current node.

```php
public delete(): mixed
```












***

### getName

Returns the name of the node.

```php
public getName(): string
```

This is used to generate the url.










***

### setName

Renames the node.

```php
public setName(string $name): mixed
```








**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** | The new name |





***

### getLastModified

Returns the last modification time, as a unix timestamp. Return null
if the information is not available.

```php
public getLastModified(): int|null
```












***

### createFile

Creates a new file in the directory.

```php
public createFile(string $name, resource|string $data = null): string|null
```

Data will either be supplied as a stream resource, or in certain cases
as a string. Keep in mind that you may have to support either.

After successful creation of the file, you may choose to return the ETag
of the new file here.

The returned ETag must be surrounded by double-quotes (The quotes should
be part of the actual string).

If you cannot accurately determine the ETag, you should not return it.
If you don't store the file exactly as-is (you're transforming it
somehow) you should also not return an ETag.

This means that if a subsequent GET to this new file does not exactly
return the same contents of what was submitted here, you are strongly
recommended to omit the ETag.






**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$name` | **string** | Name of the file |
| `$data` | **resource&#124;string** | Initial payload |
