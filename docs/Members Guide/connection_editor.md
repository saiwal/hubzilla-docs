#### Connection editor 

If you click on the ‘Edit’ button for a contact in the ‘Connections’ app, the connection editor opens.
You can use the editor to assign a specific contact role to a contact. If required, you can use the ‘Contact Roles’ button to display the existing roles and also create new roles. Another button (Compare authorisations) allows you to compare the assigned authorisations with those of the standard authorisation role.
