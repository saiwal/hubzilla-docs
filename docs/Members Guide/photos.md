#### Photos

The Photos app is a special management/viewing tool for images uploaded to your own cloud. It displays thumbnails instead of tiles or file names, which makes it easier to find specific images.

There is also a ‘Photo tools’ button that allows you to set the image as a profile picture or banner and to edit the image using a menu.
