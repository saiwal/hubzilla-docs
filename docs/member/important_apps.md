#### Important apps 

If you want to use your channel mainly for social networking, there are some apps that are not installed or activated by default, some of which are essential.

To participate in the entire Fediverse, you need to install the ‘**ActivityPub Protocol**’ app.

To make it easier to find worthwhile contacts and find out what is happening in the Fediverse, you can install and use the ‘**[Public stream](./public_stream.md)**’ app.

The ‘[**NSFW**](inhaltswarnung_NSFW.md)’ app, with which you can create and use your own content warning filters, is also useful and recommended.

You should also install the ‘[**Superblock**](superblock.md)’ app, which allows you to completely block certain users.
The ‘[**Privacy Groups**](privacy_gruppen.md)’ app is also important. This makes it possible to create contact groups and filter them, as well as to communicate with the contacts in the groups.

**<u>Please note:</u>** The ‘Public stream’ app is only available for installation if the hub administrator has activated this stream.
