### Deleting a channel

If you want to delete your channel, use the settings in the main menu (top left; profile picture): Settings → Channel settings.
At the top of the page, you will see a button labelled ‘Remove channel’. Click on it and your channel, including all content, will be deleted after you enter your account password (for security purposes).

***Note:*** It is no longer possible to create a new channel with the same name on this hub. This is because the channel nickname is locked in the database to prevent impersonation. However, if you need to restore the old channel (by cloning) on the hub, please ask the administrator to delete the locked nickname from the Hubzilla database.
