### Commenting 

If you want to comment on a post, i.e. reply to it, click in the field at the bottom of the post (‘Comment’). This opens the comment editor, which is similar to the post editor. However, there are no fields for a title, a summary or categories. Below the input field for the content of the comment there are again buttons for certain formatting (not all that are available in the post editor, because not everything is possible in a comment) and on the right again a button for a preview, as well as a ‘Submit’ button to publish the comment.

You can also mark up the text in the comment content field with Markdown, bbCode and HTML.
As there is no field for a summary, it is not possible to use this for a content warning regarding the comment. However, this can be achieved using bbCode by inserting the content warning in `[summary][/summary]`. This initially hides all of the following content, which can then be displayed by clicking on it.
