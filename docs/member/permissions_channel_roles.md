#### Permissions - User-defined channel roles 

[Channel roles](channel_roles.md) define which rights are granted when interacting with a channel. They can be accessed under ‘Settings’ → ‘Channel settings’.

The role for a channel can be defined here. Channel roles also have an influence on contact roles because individual rights that are specified and inherited from the channel roles overwrite your own settings there.
To truly customise the role permissions of your channel, you must select ‘User-defined’ as the channel role.

The other roles (‘Public’, ‘Personal’, ‘Community Forum’) are predefined authorisation roles (see: [Channel roles](channel_roles.md)).

With the customised channel roles, you can define who can perform the following interactions and how:

- Can see my channel stream and my posts
- Can send me the posts from their channel
- Can see my default profile
- Can see my connections
- Can see my file and image folders
- Can upload/modify my file and image folders
- Can see the web pages of my channel
- Can see my wiki pages
- Can create/edit web pages in my channel
- Can edit my wiki pages
- Can publish posts on my channel page (‘wall’)
- Can send me direct messages
- Can like/dislike profiles and profile stuff
- Can chat with me
- Can quote/mirror my public posts in other channels
- Can administer my channel

The following authorisations are then available for these interactions:

- Only me
- Only those you explicitly allow
- Accepted connections
- Any connections
- Everyone on this website
- All Hubzilla members
- Anyone authenticated
- Anyone on the Internet

To edit the **custom role**, select ‘Privacy settings’ in the settings. At the bottom right you will find the button ‘Custom channel role configuration’. If you click on it, a warning dialogue appears, which draws your attention to the risks of incorrect configuration. If you confirm that you want to edit the rights, the settings dialogue for the user-defined role rights opens.

**Important note:**
The user-defined roles should be set with caution and harbour the risk that the channel will no longer behave as desired with certain configurations.
