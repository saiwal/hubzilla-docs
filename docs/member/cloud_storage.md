#### Cloud storage

Your files are visible to everyone who is allowed to view them on the internet at `<URL-of-your-hub>/cloud/<your-channel-name>`. If the viewer has sufficient rights, they can also create new files and folders/directories. This option should only be used for smaller files and photos (up to a few megabytes), as it uses the internal memory. Please use WebDAV to upload larger files (videos, music, etc.). These files can still be accessed via the web access.

With WebDAV, you can copy files directly into or out of your computer's operating system, with your cloud files appearing like a virtual drive. This should be used to upload large files such as video and audio files.
The URL for the cloud directory is `<URL-of-your-hub>/dav/`.

If, depending on the DAV file system integration (depending on the operating system used and possibly the application), a username is required, this is the channel short name (i.e. without the leading ‘@’ and without the following ‘@hub address’). A possibly required password corresponds to your login password.
