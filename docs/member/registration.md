### Login / Registration 

Not all Hubzilla sites allow open registration. If registration is allowed, you will see a ‘Register’ link right next to the login prompt on the site's homepage. Following this link will take you to the site's registration page. On some sites, you may be redirected to another site that lists hubs where registration is allowed. Since all Hubzilla sites are connected, it does not matter where your account is located.

**Your e-mail address**
Please enter a valid e-mail address. Your email address will never be published. This address will be used to activate your account, to send (optional) email notifications for incoming messages or articles *and to recover lost passwords*.

**Password**
Enter a password of your choice and repeat it in the second field to ensure that it has been entered correctly. As Hubzilla offers a decentralised identity, you can use your account to log in to many other websites.

**Terms of Use**
Click on the link to read the website's terms of use. Once you have read them, confirm them by ticking the box in the registration form.

**Log in**
Once you have entered the required information, click on the ‘Register’ button. Some websites may require administrator approval before registration can be processed, in which case you will be notified. Please check your email (including your spam folder) for approval of your registration.
