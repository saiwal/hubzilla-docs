## What is Hubzilla?

Hubzilla is a decentralised communication network with the aim of providing communication options that circumvent censorship, respect privacy and are therefore free from the restrictions imposed by today's commercial communication giants. These primarily provide spy networks for paying customers of all kinds and monopolise and centralise the entire Internet - which was not originally among the revolutionary goals that led to the World Wide Web.

Hubzilla is free, open source and free of charge. It was developed to run on a Raspberry Pi as well as on the largest AMD and Intel Xeon multiprocessor servers. It can be used for communication between a few individuals or connect many thousands of people and more.

Another goal is to be independent of skills and resources. Hubzilla is as easy to use for the ordinary computer user as it is for system administrators and developers.

How you use it depends on how you want to use it.

Hubzilla is written in PHP, making it easy to install on any of today's hosting platforms, including self-hosting at home, on shared servers or on virtual and dedicated servers.

In other words, Hubzilla can run on any platform that has a web server, a MySQL-compatible database and PHP.

Hubzilla offers some unique goodies:

**One-click identification:** you can access other servers in the Hubzilla network by simply clicking on a link to them. Authentication is easily done automatically behind the scenes. Forget all the different usernames for different sites and passwords - Hubzilla does it all for you.

**Clone:** You can clone your online identity (or, as we say, a channel). It is no longer tied to a specific server, domain or IP address. Simply import it to another Hubzilla server (or Hubzilla hub, as we call it) - directly online or using a previously generated export. If your primary hub is suddenly no longer online, no problem, your contacts, posts* and messages* are still automatically available and accessible under your cloned identity. (\*: only posts and messages created after the moment of cloning)

**Privacy:** Hubzilla identities (Nomad IDs) can be deleted, backed up/downloaded and cloned. You have full control over your data. If you decide to delete all your data and your Nomad ID, all you have to do is click on a link and it will be deleted from the server immediately. No questions asked, no fuss.

## Hubzilla Features

### Built-in Social

When you post announcements on your website, they are automatically broadcast to your followers on the Fediverse, Mastodon, and more. You can also interact with them via your website.

### Groups & Forums

Building a community is important for your business or nonprofit organization. You can add public, private, and moderated discussion groups & forums. These work across nearly all fediverse platforms.

### Cloud Storage

You can store documents directly on your website, and share them with others. Public, private, or restricted access. With the files being stored on your domain name, they will know it comes from you.

### Federated Single Sign On

You can use your Hubzilla online identity to log into other websites that support Magic Signon (OpenWebAuth). That way you don't have to create a new account on every website, forum, membership site, or app.

### Nomadic Identity

Clone your online identity and content to multiple sites using the Nomad protocol and mirror any changes in near real time. All your friends and all your content are available on any of your cloned instances - at any time.
