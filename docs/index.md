# Utsukta Hub Documentation

## Welcome to Utsukta Hub

You’ve arrived at the official documentation for Utsukta Hub, a Hubzilla-powered community designed to connect people securely and privately. Whether you’re a new user, an administrator, or a developer, this is your one-stop resource for getting started, managing your experience, and diving into the technical details.

## What is Hubzilla?

Hubzilla is a decentralised communication network with the aim of providing communication options that circumvent censorship, respect privacy and are therefore free from the restrictions imposed by today's commercial communication giants. These primarily provide spy networks for paying customers of all kinds and monopolise and centralise the entire Internet - which was not originally among the revolutionary goals that led to the World Wide Web.

Hubzilla is free, open source and free of charge. It was developed to run on a Raspberry Pi as well as on the largest AMD and Intel Xeon multiprocessor servers. It can be used for communication between a few individuals or connect many thousands of people and more.

Another goal is to be independent of skills and resources. Hubzilla is as easy to use for the ordinary computer user as it is for system administrators and developers.

Hubzilla is written in PHP, making it easy to install on any of today's hosting platforms, including self-hosting at home, on shared servers or on virtual and dedicated servers.
