### Channels 

Channels are simply collections of content that are stored in one place. A channel can stand for anything. It can represent you, a website, a forum, photo albums, anything. For most people, their first channel is ‘Me’.
The most important functions for a channel that represents ‘me’ are:

- Secure and private ‘spam-free’ communication
- Identity and ‘single sign-on’ across the entire network
- Privacy controls and authorisations that extend to the entire network
- Directory services (like a phone book)

In short, a channel that represents you is ‘me on the Internet’.
With one account at a hub, several different channels can be created and used, each with its own individual configuration.
