### The stream 

The stream is the list of posts, comments and boosts from users in the Fediverse. It is sorted in reverse chronological order (the most recent posts appear at the top). Exactly which posts are shown here depends largely on your authorisation settings.
The stream (also known as the ‘timeline’ in other Fediverse services) can be filtered using various filters: by direct messages, events, polls, privacy groups, forums, flagged posts, your own posts, saved folders and names.
The stream in the Fediverse is not created by algorithms that select supposedly interesting content for the user, but is determined exclusively by the user himself. In Fediverse, you, the user, are the algorithm for the stream.
