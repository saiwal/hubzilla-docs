### Public Stream

If the administrator of a hub has activated the public stream, you as a user can install and activate the ‘Public stream’ app.

While all posts and activities from yourself and all your connections appear in the ‘normal’ stream, the public stream is more comprehensive.

There are two options:

1. If the administrator has restricted the public stream to their own hub, all public posts and activities from the streams of all users who have an account on this hub will appear there.
2. If the administrator has not restricted the public stream to their own hub, all public posts from all channels of their own hub, public content that arrives at their own hub (e.g. comments on posts by hub users that originate from other instances) and randomly collected content from channels that are known to their own hub (i.e. all contacts from all channels on their own hub) will be displayed.

The public stream is not unmoderated. The administrator of a hub has the option of deleting posts from the public stream (‘Admin delete’). These posts are then actually deleted from the public stream of their own hub. They also do not appear in the public stream view of other channels of the hub.
